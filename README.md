# Psychoactive Substances

Psychoactive Substances is a repository dedicated to providing information about various psychoactive substances. The purpose of this project is to promote harm reduction by providing accurate and unbiased information to help individuals make informed decisions about their drug use.

## Directory Structure

Each substance has its own directory, which contains files related to that substance. Files may include `substance-overview.md`, `chemical-structure.md`, `pharmacology.md`, and a directory related to the substance's effects. Inside the the `effects` directory, there are `acute-effects.md`, `long-term-effects.md`, and `withdrawl.md`. 

An example:

```
marijuana/
├── substance-overview.md
├── chemical-structure.md
├── pharmacology.md
└── effects/
    ├── acute-effects.md
    ├── long-term-effects.md
    └── withdrawal.md
```
