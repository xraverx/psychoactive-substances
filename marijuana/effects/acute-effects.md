# Acute Effects of Marijuana

Marijuana, also known as cannabis, can produce a range of acute effects, which are effects that are felt while under the influence of the drug. The specific effects can vary depending on the dose, method of use, and individual tolerance and sensitivity to the drug.

## Euphoria

One of the most common effects of marijuana is a feeling of euphoria or "high". This can be accompanied by feelings of relaxation and a decreased sense of anxiety or stress.

## Altered Perception

Marijuana can also produce changes in perception, including altered sensory experiences, changes in perception of time, and distortions of spatial perception.

## Changes in Appetite and Mood

Marijuana can also produce changes in appetite, with some users experiencing an increased appetite, commonly referred to as "the munchies". Additionally, some users may experience changes in mood, including feelings of happiness, laughter, or introspection.

## Impairment of Coordination and Cognition

Marijuana can impair coordination and cognition, making tasks that require concentration, coordination, or decision-making more difficult. This can impair driving ability, and it is illegal to drive under the influence of marijuana in many jurisdictions.

## Conclusion

Marijuana can produce a range of acute effects, including euphoria, altered perception, changes in appetite and mood, and impairment of coordination and cognition. These effects can vary depending on the dose, method of use, and individual sensitivity to the drug. It is important to use marijuana responsibly and to avoid engaging in activities that require coordination or concentration while under the influence.
