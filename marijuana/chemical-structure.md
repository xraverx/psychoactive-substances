# Marijuana Chemical Structure

Marijuana, also known as cannabis, is derived from the cannabis plant and contains several active compounds that interact with the body's endocannabinoid system. The two most well-known compounds are delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and cannabidiol (CBD).

## Delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC)

THC is the primary psychoactive compound in marijuana and is responsible for the euphoric effects commonly associated with its use. THC has a similar structure to the body's own endocannabinoid compounds and interacts with the body's CB1 and CB2 receptors, which are found throughout the brain and body. This interaction leads to a release of dopamine in the brain, which produces the feeling of euphoria.

## Cannabidiol (CBD)

CBD is a non-psychoactive compound in marijuana that has gained attention for its potential therapeutic benefits. Unlike THC, CBD does not interact with CB1 receptors in the brain, which means it does not produce the same euphoric effects. Instead, CBD is believed to interact with other receptors in the body, including those involved in pain and inflammation.

## Other Compounds

In addition to THC and CBD, marijuana contains several other compounds, including cannabigerol (CBG), cannabinol (CBN), and tetrahydrocannabivarin (THCV). These compounds may also have therapeutic benefits and are the subject of ongoing research.

## Conclusion

Marijuana contains several active compounds, including THC and CBD, that interact with the body's endocannabinoid system to produce a range of effects. Further research is needed to fully understand the mechanisms of action for each compound and to guide the development of safe and effective medicinal uses for marijuana.
